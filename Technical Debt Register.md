A Technical Debt Register is a practical tool used to track, manage, prioritize, and resolve technical debt over time. It helps make technical debt visible, actionable, and communicableâ€”especially in environments like embedded systems where decisions around performance, hardware constraints, and legacy code often increase the risk of accumulating silent debt.

### What Is a Technical Debt Register?
A Technical Debt Register is like a logbook or backlog that documents:

The technical debt items in your system

The context and impact of each

The plan or timeline for addressing them

ðŸ“Š Think of it like a bug tracker, but specifically for technical debt.

ðŸ“‹ What to Include in a Technical Debt Register?

Workflow: How to Maintain and Use a Technical Debt Register
1. Discovery & Logging
Add a new entry when a team member notices technical debt.

Encourage engineers to log issues during development or code reviews.

2. Categorize & Tag
Label the type: code smell, architectural shortcut, outdated driver, etc.

Helps in analyzing trends and areas of frequent debt.

3. Prioritize
Evaluate the business impact and technical risk.

Use models like:

High Impact + Low Effort = Fix ASAP

Low Impact + High Effort = Defer or schedule for refactor cycles

4. Track Progress
Set milestones or deadlines for important debt items.

Assign owners and review status in weekly sprint planning or technical reviews.

5. Integrate with CI/CD
Use tools like SonarQube to automatically flag and quantify technical debt.

Export reports directly into the register for traceability.

6. Review Regularly
Include it in retrospectives, code audits, or release reviews.

Ask: What debt did we add? What debt did we reduce?
