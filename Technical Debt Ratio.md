ðŸ§® What is Technical Debt Ratio?
The Technical Debt Ratio (TDR) is a metric that helps you measure how much technical debt your code has, in relation to the total size or cost of the codebase.

ðŸŸ¦ Simple Formula:
Technical Debt Ratio = (Remediation Cost / Development Cost) Ã— 100%

Remediation Cost: The estimated effort (usually in hours or dollars) to fix all the problems in the code.

Development Cost: The estimated effort it took to write the code (based on size, lines of code, etc.).

ðŸ§  Think of It Like This:
"How much of your code is 'bad enough' that it needs fixing?"

Imagine you wrote a firmware module that took 100 hours to build. A static analysis tool says fixing all code smells and design issues will take 10 hours.

TDR = (10 / 100) Ã— 100% = 10%
This means 10% of your development time is tied up in technical debt.

âœ… Interpretation Guide:

| TDR Value | What It Means                          | Action Needed?           |
| --------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| 0â€“5%      | Very low technical debt                | Maintain and monitor     |
| 5â€“10%     | Acceptable in many projects            | Start addressing it soon |
| 10â€“20%    | Risky; slowing down development        | Prioritize cleanup       |
| >20%      | High technical debt; productivity loss | Take action immediately  |

 How is TDR Measured?
Most modern tools like SonarQube or Coverity calculate it automatically. They:

Analyze your codebase for issues (bugs, code smells, duplication, etc.).

Estimate how much time it would take to fix them.

Compare it to the estimated cost/time of writing the codebase.

ðŸ“¦ Real-World Embedded Example
Youâ€™re working on firmware for a sensor hub:

Codebase size: 20,000 lines

Static analysis finds:

Missing volatile keywords in ISRs

Nested loops with high cyclomatic complexity

Global variables all over

Tool estimates 40 hours to fix

If the estimated dev time for this code is 200 hours:

ini
Copy
Edit
TDR = (40 / 200) Ã— 100% = 20%
This is a warning sign: You should prioritize refactoring before adding more features.

ðŸ“Œ Summary
TDR helps you quantify technical debt.

A lower percentage = healthier codebase.

A high TDR = slowdowns, bugs, and higher risk.

Tools like SonarQube make it easy to track over time.
