- What is the Debt Quadrant? (Martin Fowler‚Äôs Model):**

  - **Deliberate & Prudent**

  - **Deliberate & Reckless**

  - **Inadvertent & Prudent**

  - **Inadvertent & Reckless**

    ## 

  Martin Fowler‚Äôs model helps teams **categorize technical debt** based on two questions:

  1. **Did we do it on purpose or by accident?** (Deliberate vs. Inadvertent)
  2. **Did we make a wise decision or a careless one?** (Prudent vs. Reckless)

  These questions give us **4 categories** or **quadrants** of technical debt:

  ------

  ### 1. **Deliberate & Prudent**

  > **We knew we were taking on technical debt, and it was the smart thing to do.**

  #### ‚úÖ Why it's okay:

  - Sometimes you need to ship fast for a product launch, investor demo, or customer deadline.
  - You document the debt and plan to fix it soon.

  #### üìå Example:

  A team skips writing unit tests for a demo version to meet a tight deadline. They create a backlog task to add tests immediately after.

  ------

  ### 2. **Deliberate & Reckless**

  > **We knew we were taking a shortcut, and we didn‚Äôt care about the consequences.**

  #### ‚ùå Why it's risky:

  - Taking shortcuts knowingly, without planning to fix it, leads to unmaintainable systems.
  - Often driven by pressure, ego, or negligence.

  #### üìå Example:

  A developer hardcodes passwords into the codebase to "save time" and doesn‚Äôt plan to fix it later.

  ------

  ### 3. **Inadvertent & Prudent**

  > **We didn‚Äôt know better at the time, but we made reasonable decisions based on what we knew.**

  #### üå± Why it's natural:

  - As technology and your understanding improve, past decisions may turn out to be suboptimal.
  - This is the most **forgivable** kind of debt.

  #### üìå Example:

  A team designs an API structure that seems good initially but later discovers a better RESTful convention after some experience.

  ------

  ### 4. **Inadvertent & Reckless**

  > **We didn‚Äôt know what we were doing, and we didn‚Äôt care to learn.**

  #### ‚ö†Ô∏è Why it's dangerous:

  - Results from lack of experience, poor learning culture, or ignoring feedback.
  - Can cause fragile, buggy, and hard-to-maintain codebases.

  #### üìå Example:

  A junior developer copies random solutions from Stack Overflow without understanding them and doesn't ask for a code review.

  

  ## Visual Summary

  | Intent      | Understanding | Type                      | Example                                  |
  | ----------- | ------------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
  | Deliberate  | Prudent       | Smart trade-off           | Skip tests for demo, fix right after     |
  | Deliberate  | Reckless      | Shortcut with no fix plan | Hardcoded passwords, no intention to fix |
  | Inadvertent | Prudent       | Honest mistake            | Chose poor API structure, learned later  |
  | Inadvertent | Reckless      | Careless or unskilled     | Pasting code blindly from the internet   |
